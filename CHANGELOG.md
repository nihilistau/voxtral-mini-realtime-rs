# Changelog

## 0.3.0 (Shannon-Prime Fork)

### Added

- **Real-time waveform visualizer (browser)** — Canvas-based scrolling waveform
  in `space/waveform.js` with peak-bucketed downsampling, 60fps rendering via
  `requestAnimationFrame`, high-DPI support, and automatic resize via
  `ResizeObserver`. Color-coded: orange for microphone, blue for file playback.
  Wired into `VoxtralClient` via the `onAudioChunk` callback.

- **Real-time waveform visualizer (CLI TUI)** — ratatui + crossterm terminal UI
  in `src/tui/` with Unicode block-character amplitude bars (▁▂▃▄▅▆▇█).
  Activated via `voxtral transcribe --tui`. Shows live waveform, transcription
  text, and status bar. Press `q` or `Esc` to exit.

- **Shared ring buffer** — `src/audio/ring_buffer.rs` provides a fixed-capacity
  circular buffer with `push_slice()` for audio ingestion and `snapshot_peaks(width)`
  for peak-bucketed downsampling to any display width. Used by both the browser
  and CLI waveform renderers.

- **Shannon-Prime VHT2 KV cache compression** — Vilenkin-Hartley Transform
  spectral-domain banded quantization in `src/models/layers/shannon_prime.rs`.
  Achieves ~4.6x KV cache compression with negligible quality impact. Wraps the
  existing `KVCache` transparently via `ShannonPrimeKVCache`.

- **Documentation suite** — `docs/SETUP.md` (installation and build guide),
  `docs/USAGE.md` (CLI and API usage reference), `docs/WASM_API.md` (browser
  JavaScript API for VoxtralClient and WaveformRenderer).

- **Project management files** — `plan.md`, `state.md`, `handoff.md` for
  session continuity and development tracking.

### Changed

- `space/index.html` — replaced CSS-animated mic bars with Canvas waveform.
- `space/voxtral-client.js` — added `onAudioChunk` callback and `AnalyserNode`
  for real-time mic data at ~20fps.
- README updated with fork additions, TUI usage, and documentation links.

### Fixed

- **VHT2 energy concentration test** — was asserting spectral energy
  concentration in the first quarter (incorrect for Walsh-Hadamard butterflies).
  Replaced with `test_vht2_energy_preservation` verifying Parseval's theorem
  (total energy preserved through transform), which is the actual invariant for
  the compression scheme.

## 0.2.1

### Fixed

- **Incorrect `head_dim` in LanguageModel constructors.** `head_dim` was computed
  as `d_model / n_heads` (96), but the Voxtral decoder config specifies
  `head_dim = 128` — an independent parameter with GQA (32Q/8KV). This caused a
  tensor shape mismatch in KV cache pre-allocation during inference.

- **OOM when loading large SafeTensors models.** Switched from reading the entire
  file into a `Vec<u8>` to memory-mapping via `mmap`, eliminating a redundant
  copy and keeping peak memory close to the model size.
  Contributed by [@johnnyshields](https://github.com/johnnyshields) in [#6](https://github.com/TrevorS/voxtral-mini-realtime-rs/pull/6).

### Changed

- Corrected documentation to say BF16 (not F32) for SafeTensors weight precision —
  9 GB / 4B params = ~2.25 bytes/param = BF16, matching the HuggingFace model page.
  ([#5](https://github.com/TrevorS/voxtral-mini-realtime-rs/issues/5))

- Improved GGUF local usage documentation.

## 0.2.0

> Performance numbers measured on NVIDIA DGX Spark (GB10, LPDDR5x) for Vulkan,
> Apple M4 Max for Metal, and headless Chromium (DGX Spark) for WASM/WebGPU.

### Added

- **Long audio chunking** — audio exceeding the GPU's shared-memory limit is
  automatically split into chunks (default: 1200 mel frames) with overlap for
  continuity. Chunks are transcribed sequentially and concatenated.
  Contributed by [@sleep3r](https://github.com/sleep3r) in [#3](https://github.com/TrevorS/voxtral-mini-realtime-rs/pull/3).
- **Criterion pipeline benchmarks** (`cargo bench q4_pipeline`) — sequential
  stage-level benchmarks for model load, preprocessing, encoding, and full
  transcription with regression tracking.

### Performance

- **Q4 native: 0.416 RTF, 19.4 tok/s** (down from 0.535 RTF / 14.5 tok/s).
  Tiled WGSL shader with shared-memory tiling for single-token decode,
  vectorized u32 reads, and vec4 dot products.
- **F32 native: 1.543 RTF, 4.6 tok/s** — Q4 decode is 4.2× faster than F32.

### Fixed

- **Tiled Q4 shader corruption on Metal.** Baking dimensions as compile-time
  WGSL constants via `SourceTemplate` caused CubeCL's pipeline cache to serve
  stale pipelines when many shape variants accumulated during inference. Both
  kernels now read dimensions from a runtime info buffer, producing a single
  cached pipeline per kernel variant.

- **Q4 produces all-pad tokens on quiet audio (44.59% → 8.49% WER on FLEURS
  English).** 37% of FLEURS utterances had peak amplitude below 0.02, producing
  mel spectrograms indistinguishable from silence after log normalization. Added
  `peak_normalize(0.95)` before mel computation so Q4 can resolve subtle
  features. Normal-volume audio is barely affected (~0.05 log-space shift).
- **Q4 inference fails on audio without leading silence.** The Q4_0 quantized
  model is sensitive to speech content in the 38-token streaming prefix. Audio
  that starts immediately with speech (e.g. mic recordings with no silence)
  produced all-pad tokens and "no speech detected." Increased left padding from
  32 to 76 tokens so the full prefix sees only silence. The upstream
  mistral-common default of 32 works for f32 inference but is insufficient for
  Q4. ([details in `src/audio/pad.rs`](src/audio/pad.rs))

### Changed

- HuggingFace Space deployment (static SDK, model shards fetched from CDN)
- Browser UI redesign with weights caching via Cache API
- Audio resampling in browser uses `OfflineAudioContext` for correct 16 kHz conversion
- WASM uses naive-only Q4 kernel dispatch (tiled kernel produces incorrect
  results on WebGPU due to a CubeCL bind group layout issue with mixed binding
  counts)
